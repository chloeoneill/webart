      <h2>GET TO KNOW ME</h2>
      
      <p>Hello, my name is Chloe! I have been a photographer for the last eight years and started getting into graphic design two years ago. I enjoy incorporating writing into my practice as well, either it be through process or within the final piece. I write mainly short-form fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, recently within the horror genre for some reason? </p>
        
        <p>Most of my photography is centered around discomfort, ephemerality, femininity, body, and sexuality, mainly focusing on self portraiture. I have discovered the true extent our body gestures mirror our own feelings about the environment we are in. I enjoy putting myself in uncomfortable situations, either it be a sex shop or Lake Michigan on a freezing day. It is incredibly important to capture each small detail within my portraits. Our bodies have so much to tell us, each with a story of their own. I invite my viewers to come close and explore those miniscule gestures.  </p>
        
        <p>This year, I am looking forward to finding ways to incorporate my quite solidified photography practice with my graphic design work. I'm interested in finding new forms of research and planning for my work. </p>

      <h2>Finding a Relationship to my Work</h2>

      <p>What makes me most excited to create something is a strong vision. I often find myself getting inspired by small, almost insignificant things in my life and wanting to create projects centered around the feelings I get from this topic, either it be love, hate, disgust, compassion, etc. My feelings change towards these topics as I explore them further, shaping the way the work develops. One example of this was when I started doing self-portraiture. In my photography leading up to this, I felt a disconnect between myself and the camera, making my images seem almost disingenuous or overly thought out. However, once I stepped in as the subject being photographed, the way I saw my work changed. It felt much more intimate and raw, I could see my eyes, my intention, staring back at me through each photograph.</p>

      <p>When incorporating the self in my work, there is this level of vulnerability that comes with it. I often feel as if I am sharing too much, or not enough, leading to this level of anxiety around the project. I think the same way with my design work. I find myself creating design projects that reflect what I believe others want to see from me, there is that lack of self in these projects that I am still grappling with. While I have found some resolve within my photographic work, I still see that disconnect in my designs. Up until recently, my assignments were often more focused on form and function rather than style and emanating personal aesthetics. Now that I have fully delved into Visual Communications at SAIC, I want to find a way to insert myself further within my work. Hopefully, along the way, I will find a way to bridge the gap between my two mediums.</p>

      <p>I do not find myself dropping projects altogether, rather I adjust them according to time constraints, my finances, or just the overall end goal. Each of my projects finds its momentum in different ways, allowing it to grow or develop on its own. I do find myself, however, pushing my boundaries much less in my design work. I am worried about experimenting so much that I lose the functional elements of my design. It is quite difficult to balance functionality and inserting my personal identity within the work I am creating. I also question to what extent I should be inserting myself, or if I should at all. Because of this, the vision within my work is not as distinct or clear as it can be with my photography.</p>

      <p>When I finish a project and it is exactly how I pictured it based on my initial vision, I feel an immense sense of pride. To me, nothing feels better than my work looking how I imagined it and having it received well by others. I will sometimes post it on my social media for others to see, or create prints of it for my archive; however, if it is something that I am not as proud of or is not received in the best way, I find myself burying it deep. I always want to revisit it at some point to find some sense of resolve, but I get far too excited about the next project to bother putting any more effort into the first. This is something that I want to work on within my practice, finding some sense of longevity and immortality in each of my projects (only if it is deserved, of course). However, I have started reconciling this issue by creating space between the critique and the completion of the project. This allows me to look at it with fresh eyes and make adjustments with a clearer (and less critical) head.</p>
